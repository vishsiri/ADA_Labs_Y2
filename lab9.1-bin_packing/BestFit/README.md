# Explanation of the Given Code

## BFBinPacking

The `BFBinPacking` function implements the Bin Packing algorithm using the Best Fit heuristic. The function takes the following parameters:

- `n`: The number of objects to be packed.
- `BinS`: The size of each bin.
- `s`: A slice containing the sizes of the objects to be packed.
- `Bin`: A slice that will be populated with the bin number assigned to each object.

The function returns the number of bins used to pack all the objects.

## printObjectAndBin

The `printObjectAndBin` function prints the object size and the bin number assigned to it. The function takes the following parameters:

- `n`: The number of objects to be packed.
- `s`: A slice containing the sizes of the objects to be packed.
- `Bin`: A slice containing the bin number assigned to each object.

## printBinj

The `printBinj` function prints the objects that are packed in a particular bin. The function takes the following parameters:

- `n`: The number of objects to be packed.
- `B`: The bin number for which the objects are to be printed.
- `s`: A slice containing the sizes of the objects to be packed.
- `Bin`: A slice containing the bin number assigned to each object.

## PackAndPrint

The `PackAndPrint` function packs the objects using the `BFBinPacking` function and prints the sizes of the objects and the bins used to pack them. The function takes the following parameters:

- `n`: The number of objects to be packed.
- `BinSize`: The size of each bin.
- `s`: A slice containing the sizes of the objects to be packed.
- `Bin`: A slice that will be populated with the bin number assigned to each object.

## sortObjects

The `sortObjects` function sorts the objects in decreasing order of size. The function takes the following parameters:

- `n`: The number of objects to be packed.
- `x`: A slice containing the sizes of the objects to be sorted.

## main

The `main` function initializes the variables and calls the `PackAndPrint` function twice, once with the original order of objects and once with the objects sorted in decreasing order of size using the `sortObjects` function.
